#TASK DESCRIPTION

ALU(Arithmetic Logic Unit) is a computational unit capable of performing any logical or arithmetic operations assigned to the machine. I have performed an ALU unit for AND, OR, Addition, Subtraction, NOT Operations. My unit is of 8-bit memory. I used EDA playground to simulate the results of my task coded using Verilog HDL. The simulation results are shown using Icarus verilog extension provided by the playground. Every operation is coded by assigning a 3-bit value to each.
